What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

It prepares the directory for git to use it. 
I need to do this to have starting point for 
commiting my changes.

How is the staging area different from the 
working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?

It is useful in case I do not want to add all
the files in my directory to the repos.
